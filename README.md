# ASSIGNMENT01: Heuristic Evaluation - CHRIS HUNT, DH110

## About this project.

Since COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020 temporarily closed schools in person teaching a lot of them moved to remote or online versions of their prior only physical product. This new category has a high demand with 5.1 million users in 2020 with a project CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 17.7% and with a estimated market revenue of $130.7 million dollars in 2020 there's a ton of money up for grabs. I'm taking a look at two music learning/theory website/applications and seeing what I can learn from both in terms of good/bad UX choices and how I can improve the overall user experience in order for people to have a easier time using the products. The piano and guitar are the top 2 in market share and I chose 2 applications that cover both of those. One that will help with learning music theory to be applied to a multitude of music related things from learning to play the piano to singing. The other one is guitar based and requires a subscription past a certain amount of days to continue to access the information. I hope to show how we can improve the user's expeirence on both of these platforms in order to offer a great experience for each and every user.
